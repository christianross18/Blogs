# About the Grant Project
My project is about making an interactive timeline about the ancient kingdom of the Kush. I wanted to do a timeline because I thought it would make explaining the project very simple. I also wanted to do a timeline because I like how timelines organize and present information.

I was interested in the Kush kingdom because around the time I had to choose a topic, I had watched a video about the kingdoms of Nubia which included the Kush and the kingdom of Aksum that followed. The video was very interesting and so there was no question what area I wanted to do my topic in. I ended up settling for Kush because it was the kingdom that came first although I kind of regret not doing Aksum as I thought they were cooler, mostly because they were more advanced version of Kush civilization.

When I first wrote my abstract, I knew what I wanted to do, but not how to do it or what the result would exactly look like. As I did my research, the details gradually began to fill in and a clearer picture of what it would look like came into my head. The resource that helped me the most about imagining my project was when I went looking for my timeline tool which I ended up settling for Timeline JS. While looking through the examples, I imagined putting information about the Kush kingdom into the timeline and adding images that I saw from throughout my research. Overall, the main idea of the abstract didn’t change, but the detail for it did.  

There were other similar timelines for the Kush kingdom that I encountered through my research, but I could not really call any of them DH projects. They always lacked something whether it was user interactivity or the lack of information. My project seeks to become better than these examples by combining the good elements of the timelines I found and making them better to create a unique source of information that is accessible to everyone.   
   
Through writing the grant, I learned that even though you might have a good idea for a project, it does not mean that other people may think so unless you explain it well. While writing my grant, I kept running into problems of not writing enough, but that is because I was not writing enough. Every time I reread my grant, whether it was the narrative or the environmental scan, there always seemed to be something that was not explained properly or something needing extra detail. Eventually, I managed to get through writing the grant while also properly detailing everything so that someone who is not me can understand the points that I am trying to make.

# About my Time in English 350
Before the course, I had no idea what Digital Humanities was, in fact I have never heard the term before. I knew what the humanities was, and I knew what digital things were also, but I did not think that combining the two created something new. The initial definition that associated with DH was humanities done digitally which makes sense with my prior knowledge. However, after learning about it a little I made the small change to the definition, so it is now the humanities enhanced digitally. It’s a small change, but it made all the difference when trying to identify what is DH and what is not.

I did not particularly enjoy the readings because some of the readings were too long, some contained pointless information that deviated from the main point and some were, I thought, just wrong. There were also some more strictly informational ones where skimming was the best method to extract information from the text. One good thing about the readings were that they said new things that I wasn’t exposed to before whether it be new opinions or new skills. So although I didn’t like the readings in general, they did their job by showing me new information.

There were not any assignments that I struggled with or enjoyed a lot. However, I would say that finishing the grant was the best part of the course for me as it was my greatest accomplishment in the course. One a thing that I struggled with more than I should have were the twitter posts as it was also the second post that was the hardest to come up with something to say. Overall, I had an alright time with the assignments and the course in general.

It is difficult for me to measure my growth as a writer as every time I write, I fix mistakes and bad habits over my time in a class, but then I make them during my next semester or next writing course. I suppose that as a writer this course has been good practice for me and my writing. Another thing that this course helped with was introducing myself to DH as now I know the value of DH and what it could do for the many different types of people out there.
