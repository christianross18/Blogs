I have recently had my first experience with the Text Coding Initiative (TEI) in a DH assignment. The assignment was to convert text from the short story "The Yellow Wallpaper" by Charlotte Perkin Stetson to eXtensible Markup Language (XML). The story is about a woman who is having mental issues and begins a treatment that makes it worse and she ends up going instead. I was assigned pages 8-11, where the narrator is describing her initial reaction to the yellow wallpaper.  

The assignment started off by marking down the text in google docs. The parts of text with new paragraphs, added words and dialogue among other things were commented in the document. This made it easier to tag in XML as it was easy to know where things went.

When I first saw what XML was about, I knew I would have an easy time doing the assignment. I have done coding in the past and currently as a part of my computer science major. I also had some minor experience working with html in Code Academy back in middle school.  

The assignment was, as expected, quite easy as it must have taken about thirty minutes for the entire assigned text. I started by placing all the needed paragraph and page break tags which organized my work. Then I just placed in the rest of the tags where they needed to go, and I was done.  

The only complication that I ran into was some of the tags I copied had the wrong quotation marks which were not recognized by the XML service. It took a minute to figure out was wrong and it was fixed easily by retyping the quotation marks.

Although my TEI experience was not long, it was still cool to work through and reconnected me to my tagging skills.
