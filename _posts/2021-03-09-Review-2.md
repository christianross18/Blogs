## Summary  
The project is a mapping of the London WW2 bomb census for the bombings from 7/10/40 to 6/6/41. For each bombing, information about the type, place, nearby images, and any related stories about the bomb are given. There are three different maps. The first shows all the bombs in the period, the second shows the first 24 hours of the blitz, and the third shows the bombings from Oct. 7 to the 14th.

## Technology  
The website uses web mapping but does not say which one they used. The website is also in a responsive mode that the website claims it can smoothly resize elements on the page so that the website is functional on many different types of devices. The project also comes with an android app that uses augmented reality to allow yourself to discover nearby bomb droppings while in traveling around London.   
## Humanistic Importance   
The project presents information that was only accessible from the reading room in the national archive. This allows the information to be accessed anywhere with internet connection. This project mainly focuses on the bombs dropped during the initial German blitz on London and its focus is a boon to people interested in the blitz bombings of london. The project may struggle to interest a larger audience as it does not do anything to grab the attention of the random passerby.   
## Review of Features  
![Messy Main Map][Messy Main Map]   
The website has a lot of features in it. The map itself is well developed as it loads fast and has a good host of supporting features. These features include on-screen controls which are helpful for mobile users and a non-intrusive legend for the various symbols included on the map. The user can also change the layers on the map and choose some of what is displayed, like the anti-invasion sites. Each bubble on the map also has an image on it which gives information immediately to the user. The map also has an information box above it which gives background information and a tutorial of the map. A problem with the map is that it is impossible to see anything while zoomed out. This can be alleviated a little bit by adding a filter to filter out different types of symbols which should clear up the map a bit and gives the user more control over the information presented. Another way to fix it would be to allow larger groupings of bombs which I have seen work on similar maps with great effect.

The website also has a way to see more detailed information on specific places or bombs. The information includes stories or images that happen at or near those places. There is also a map of the place but is non-interactive and can be crowded with bubbles if the map is zoomed out too much. The stories are accessed through a drop down which collapses once another story is opened. Links to the source of the story are found at the bottom of each story. A back to the top button also exists at the bottom which allows easier access to the start of the story. The Images can be viewed through a slideshow which makes switching to different images easier. However, the arrows to go to the next image change places depending on the size of the image which can change. Making the next and previous arrows stay in the same spot would be good as it makes accessing the next image even easier. Also it seems that the link to the android app is broken or the app does not exist.

Overall the project does a good job of doing what it set out to do, but there are improvements that could be made such as appealing to a wider audience. However, these improvements would only affect the ease of access to the information and it would not detract from how the information is presented nor its quality.
