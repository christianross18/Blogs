####Hello,
my name is _Christian Ross_, and I am a student at Christopher Newport University. I am majoring in Computer Science and I **love** it. I am currently a junior, but I might stay for my graduate degree.  
I am planning to get my graduate degree at either here or at Virginia Tech, the latter would be preferable because it is within walking distance to my house. I do not have a specific interest in what job I want, but I would like it if my future job included programming because I enjoy the problem-solving aspect of it.  
On the job-related note, I am currently looking for a job for the summer, it will be my first job and I hope that it will give me insight on what I want to do with my future.  
I am taking this digital humanities course because it might give me a different perspective and skills that will be helpful in the future. I made my first major social media
account for this class and it made me only a little _nervous_. I never really got into social media before because I felt the hassle of checking my account every so often was
not worth it. I also did not do it because posting things online is permanent and I did not want anything dumb to come up in the future. I also enjoy the presence of others
when I interact with them which also explains why I do not text nor call people much except if something is needed.  
Some random facts about me are that I have a twin brother and he goes to CNU too, but he does not look like me, so you do not have to worry about _doppelgangers_. I have a cute dog and I have the duty to say that my dog is the **best** dog in the world which is just a factually true statement.
**I am looking forward to this class and I hope I can learn some new things.**
