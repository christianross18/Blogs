# Summary  
_Witches in Scotland_ is a visual representation of the witches of Scotland through maps and charts. The site has maps of the known residences, trial, and execution places of witches. It also shows extra information such as gender, social class, and occupation if known. The site also shows maps of people related to the trials and witches, such as spouses and bailiffs. It also has charts for stats on execution methods and torture methods. All these features help the project's goal of visualizing the witches in Scotland.

# Design  
The site uses the ArcGIS Online mapping service to create some of the maps. Each tab on the page has an information button that provides more information about what is displayed. Some of the maps are filterable, but not all them. One of the filterable maps has the feature non collapsible which makes the map much harder to see. The project director has also pointed out some accessibility problems with the site. This includes some images missing alternative text and some links are not navigable by only keyboard.  
# Relevance  
The project does a good job at showing relevant witch places by using interactive maps. By creating maps, the information is navigable through visuals. This provides friendlier access to a more casual research. More information about Scotland's witches located throughout the site. This is through the maps, other tabs on the site, or through the project's references and resources.   
# Findings   
Omit the project does a good job of an interactive mapping of the witches of Scotland. The filters of some of the maps do a good job at narrowing down data, but not all the maps have this feature. Not all the maps are of the same design. This can be good as each map shows the specified information in the best way possible. It could also be a bad thing as it creates an inconsistency of feel and features that each map provides.

The tabs create a well organized site and allow quick access to relevant information. The charts in the tabs provides information in a different way. The charts are changeable to a different types of charts that can be more preferable to the user. There are also some bonus maps and links in some tabs which are fun extras to the site.

In conclusion, the project is good for the amount of information it gives. Also by including bonus information, the site can keep the user interested. The extra information also is interesting to look at for a casual audience.
